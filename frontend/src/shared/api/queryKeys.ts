/**
 * Enterprise TanStack Query key factory (v5).
 *
 * Boundary: Server State ONLY. All REST data fetched via TanStack Query MUST
 * use these keys — never inline string literals. This guarantees:
 * - no key duplication / typos across features,
 * - precise invalidation (e.g. messages(convId) without nuking the list),
 * - stable referential shape for `setQueryData` realtime sync.
 *
 * Backwards compatibility: legacy flat string constants are kept as aliases
 * to the factory roots so existing imports/tests keep working. New code MUST
 * use the `queryKeys` factory.
 *
 * Convention: every key is a readonly tuple, first segment is the collection,
 * subsequent segments narrow the scope: [collection, ...params].
